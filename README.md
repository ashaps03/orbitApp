# orbitApp
Orbit is a community-driven social app designed to help people connect locally through shared interests, group chats, and real-time updates. Instead of chasing followers, Orbit focuses on meaningful interactions. It lets users join communities, create group circles, and expand their “orbit” by meeting new people in a natural, authentic way.
